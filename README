What is Stuffy?

A Python library that allows programs to send a dictionary from one instance of a Stuffy-enabled program to another
(remote) instance using only email addresses for routing.  The only restriction placed the data sent is that it must be
possible to convert it to a JSON document.  This still allows Stuffy-enabled applications to maintain a great deal of
control over what can be sent since almost anything can be sent in a JSON document.  Such a dictionary will be referred
to the "Dictionary Of Stuff" or a 'dict_of_stuff' for short.  The dict_of_stuff is actually transferred by adding it to
a Stuffy Object.  This object includes addressing information and other status info.

The objects travel between programs via a mongoDB database. The basic idea is as follows:
> The sending (node) program does the following:
>> Adds the dict_of_stuff to a StuffyObject (SO).
>> Adds the email addresses of the recipients who will receive a copy of the SO.
>> Writes the SO to the "post_office" data collection of the mongoDB database.
> The sentinel program then does the following:
>> Reads the new SO.
>> Sets the "delivered" field to True
>> Writes the modified SO into the "home" collections of all the recipients defined in the SO.
>> Updates the SO in the "post_office" collection so that the "delivered" field is set to True.
> The receiving (node) program does the following:
>> Reads the SO from it's "home" collection.
>> Sets the "already_read" field of the SO in the collection to True

The sentinel program will delete SO's in the "post_office" collection once they have reached a configured age.  The
receiving program will be able to delete messages from its own "home" collection.

The API:
from stuffy import StuffyNode, StuffyObject
help(StuffyNode)
help(StuffyObject)

Restrictions:
1. It must be possible to convert the dictionary to a JSON document.
2. Dictionary keys that are not strings will be converted to strings.  This is a restriction imposed by the PyMongo
library.
